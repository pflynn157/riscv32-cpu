Hard-drive ports:

IN/OUT: <4><4><4>
-> Part 1: device type
   Part 2: device num
   Part 3: device op
   
Device types:
1-> hard drives

Drive Num = 4 bits (16 drives)
Drive Op = 4 bits (16 operations)
Data = 32 bits

Drive operations (for simplicity, assume linear drive):
0 -> ping
1 -> seek
2 -> Read
3 -> Write
4 -> Ready

So:
If "OUT" sends 0x100 -> ping hard drive 0
   "OUT" sends 0x122 -> read hard drive 2
